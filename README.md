## Milestones:

### Casey:

## I struggled through learning a new CSS framework, but it was worth it.

## After learning the framework, I had fun manipulating elements to stack neatly on different screen sizes.

### Garrett:

## Dealing with multiple fetch requests and accounting for the time it takes them to complete was a challenge.

## I learned about the strange things that can happen when you mix asynchronous and synchronous functions and how to work around them.

### Jennifer:

## I learned that the group could break up into teams on different efforts for the project and just meet as a group during the group project times.  It is probably a better idea for one person to be the project 

## As convenient as W3Schools is for designing cards and making design easy, it clutters the code and makes it harder to manipulate simple things.
